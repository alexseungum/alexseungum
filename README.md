## About Me ðŸ«¡
I am a rising third year at UC Berkeley's College of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering/Operations Research, with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. I am actively looking for internship opportunities to learn more about the intersection of hardware and software along with exploring the world of machine learning and data!
